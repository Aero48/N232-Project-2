#Somewhere New
This is a short platformer game I made as my final project for a game development class. The goal is to beat levels 1-1 through 1-4 although there may be something preventing you from doing so. 
Most of the graphics come from Kenney's 2D Platformer asset packs: https://kenney.nl/assets/category:2D/page:2?sort=update
